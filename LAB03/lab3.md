#Reflection

#1. How do I approach writing recursive functions?
#When I write a recursive function, the first thing I do is figure out the base case the simplest situation where I can return an answer directly without calling the function again. 
#After that, I think about how to break the bigger problem into a smaller version of the same problem. Each recursive call must move closer to the base case, 
#otherwise it will loop forever. I usually test it on small inputs first to make sure the function stops correctly and builds up the right answer.

#2. How do I analyze recursive functions?
#To analyze a recursive function, I write down how much work is done at each step and then set up a recurrence relation (for example, T(n) = T(n-1) + 5). 
#Then I expand it step by step until it reaches the base case. This shows me the total number of operations and helps me find the Big-O complexity.

#3. How is it different from analyzing non-recursive functions? How is it the same?
#The difference is that for recursive functions, I have to think in terms of a recurrence and expansions, while for non-recursive functions I usually just count loop operations directly. 
#The similarity is that in both cases, Iâ€™m still counting operations, summing them up, and then simplifying to Big-O notation. 
#The goal is the same: to measure efficiency in terms of time and space.
